# GINFIN 

A very basic tui-engine im working on to improve my Rust.

# Functionality
- Draw Individual characters
- Draw text
- Draw horizontal and vertical lines
- Draw boxes

Lines that cross each other will be joined together on the screen.
This makes for a smoother look.
Unfortunately so far, edges look as litle onky, as the lines are joined with 4-way-pieces (UTF-8: U+256d).
This will be changed in the future.
